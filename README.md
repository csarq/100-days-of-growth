# 100-days-of-growth
My personal 100-day log challenge to elevate my technical skills and well-being.
From 12 December 2024 

**Technical Focus:**
* Data Engineering/Analytics
* Cybersecurity

**Personal Wellness:**
* Weight Loss: 10kg

## Day 1
Returning from a long, refreshing and inspiring holiday, I was surprised to find access granted to one of the Udacity subject areas I applied for through the Bertelsmann Next Generation Tech Booster!

However, there are some pre-requisites I wasn't aware of, and it may take me several days to revise/learn these points. Today, I spent some time:

* Learning about different types of malware and common hacking techniques employed by malicious actors.
* Reading about the CIA Triad from [this article](https://www.csoonline.com/article/568917/the-cia-triad-definition-components-and-examples.html).

I did a couple sessions of stretching as I have a bad cold.

## Day 2

Walked for over three hours in the morning, and did some extra walking in the afternoon. I skimmed through some of the pre-requisite info for the Udacity course and made some notes on:

* Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) model
* Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP-IP) model
* Three-way handshake
