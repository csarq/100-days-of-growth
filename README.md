# 100-days-of-growth
My personal 100-day log challenge to elevate my technical skills and well-being. 

**Technical Focus:**
* Data Engineering/Analytics
* Cybersecurity

**Personal Wellness:**
* Weight Loss: 10kg

## Day 1
Returning from a long, refreshing and inspiring holiday, I was surprised to find access granted to one of the Udacity subject areas I applied for through the Bertelsmann Next Generation Tech Booster!

However, there are some pre-requisites I wasn't aware of, and it may take me several days to revise/learn these points. Today, I spent some time:

* Learning about different types of malware and common hacking techniques employed by malicious actors.
* Reading about the CIA Triad from [this article](https://www.csoonline.com/article/568917/the-cia-triad-definition-components-and-examples.html).

I did a couple sessions of stretching as I have a bad cold
